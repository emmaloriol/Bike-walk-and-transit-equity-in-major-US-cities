# Bike-walk-and-transit-equity-in-major-US-cities

Come check out the work I have been doing as a Research Assistant at Seattle University with Dr. Ariana Mendible! This project explores neighborhood 'walk scores', 'bike scores' and 'transit scores' (scored by WalkScore, a subsidiary of Redfin) and how they may relate to historic discrimination and gentrification within neighborhoods of large US cities. 

While this project is still taking shape, I want to share what I've been up to so far! Check out these files for some fun geospatial analysis, along with insights into equity in biking, transit, and walking. All the code you'll find in those files is my own. 

Check out 'Census block exploration' to see exploration of median household income in Seattle and its association to bike, walk, and transit score by census block.
